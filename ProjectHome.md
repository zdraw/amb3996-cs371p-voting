from UVa online judge:
"Australian ballots require that the voter rank the candidates in order of choice. Initially only the first choices are counted and if one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, that candidate is elected. If no candidate receives more than 50%, all candidates tied for the lowest number of votes are eliminated. Ballots ranking these candidates first are recounted in favour of their highest ranked candidate who has not been eliminated. This process continues [is, the lowest candidate is eliminated and each ballot is counted in favour of its ranked non-eliminated candidate](that.md) until one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote or until all candidates are tied."

Write a program that takes as input the candidates and ballots and computes the winner of the election.
